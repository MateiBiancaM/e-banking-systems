# e-banking-systems
This Java OOP project simulates an e-banking system. It features a robust, layered class hierarchy (console/GUI) modeling accounts and transactions. All state changes are processed in-memory using Java collections, with persistence managed exclusively via file I/O, demonstrating core design principles.
